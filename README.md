# Serious Cryptography in C

This repository contains C implementations of cryptographic concepts explored in *Serious Cryptography* by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and published by No Starch Press. The goal is to supplement my reading with actual practice in code.

## About the Book  
*Serious Cryptography* dives deep into cryptographic algorithms, their security properties, and real-world applications. This repository follows along with the book, providing C implementations for various topics.

## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have a C compiler installed. GCC or Clang is recommended.

### Compilation  
To compile an example, navigate to the corresponding directory and use:  
```gcc -o output_file source_file.c -Wall -Wextra```
